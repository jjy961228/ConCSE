Our proposed Koglish_dataset consists of Koglish_GLUE,Koglish_NLI,Koglish_STS.
All datasets are uploaded to "https://huggingface.co/Jangyeong" and can be downloaded by running download_dataset.py.
For example, in the cola task of Koglish_GLUE dataset, "cs_train" contains our proposed English-Korean Code-Switched data and the original English dataset. Also, "en_train" contains only the original English dataset.

Dataset Koglish_GLUE is used for the Koglish dataset validation experiment in section 5.1, and Datasets Koglish_NLI and Koglish_STS are used for our proposed ConCSE experiment.
